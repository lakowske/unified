# Development Journal

This document tracks significant issues, roadblocks, and solutions encountered during the unified infrastructure project development.

## Major Infrastructure Issues & Solutions

### 1. Poststack Migration System Reliability (July 2025)

**Issue**: Custom poststack migration system was unreliable with frequent tracking conflicts

- Migration tracking failed when tables already existed
- "relation 'users' already exists" errors prevented deployments
- Complex custom logic (4,738 lines) difficult to maintain and debug
- No industry-standard patterns or battle-tested reliability

**Root Cause**: Immature migration tracking system with poor conflict resolution

**Solution**: Complete replacement with Flyway

- Migrated to industry-standard Flyway database migrations
- Converted all migration files to Flyway naming convention (V1\_\_, V2\_\_, etc.)
- Eliminated 64% of custom code while improving reliability
- Migrations now complete in 0.061 seconds with zero conflicts

**Impact**: Major improvement in deployment reliability and maintenance burden

### 2. DNS Container Permission Issues (July 2025)

**Issue**: BIND DNS container stuck in restart loops due to permission problems

- `/var/cache/bind` directory not writable by bind user
- Configuration file access denied errors
- Container running as root instead of secure bind user
- Health checks failing due to service crashes

**Root Cause**: Incorrect permission setup and Docker/Podman compatibility issues

**Solution**: Fixed container permissions and user context

- Updated entrypoint script to properly set `/var/cache/bind` ownership
- Restored proper non-root execution as bind user with `-u bind` flag
- Fixed Dockerfile base image reference for Docker compatibility
- Rebuilt container with corrected permission handling

**Impact**: DNS service now stable and secure, resolving domains correctly

### 3. Test Data System Cleanup & Standardization (July 2025)

**Issue**: Test data system had obsolete artifacts and inconsistent references from multiple development iterations

- Validation data contained references to non-existent environments (fullstack.test.local, feature-auth.test.local)
- Test fixtures included obsolete services (redis, prometheus, grafana)
- README documentation was outdated and confusing
- Integration tests only checked basic postgres connectivity instead of full service stack
- Test artifacts from multiple development phases created confusion

**Root Cause**: Rapid development cycles led to accumulation of obsolete test data and documentation

**Solution**: Comprehensive cleanup and standardization

- Cleaned up all validation data files to only include current test-env-1 and test-env-2 environments
- Updated integration tests to validate full service stack (postgres, apache, mail, dns)
- Simplified test environments to 2 comprehensive full-stack environments with proper port isolation
- Updated README documentation to reflect actual current structure
- Verified all tests pass with cleaned-up code and data

**Impact**: Clear, maintainable test system that accurately reflects current infrastructure

### 4. Podman Compose vs Docker Compose Compatibility (July 2025)

**Issue**: Init container dependencies not working properly with podman-compose

- `--profile` flag not supported in podman-compose version 1.0.6
- Service dependency resolution issues with init containers
- Complex workarounds required for proper startup ordering

**Root Cause**: Podman-compose lacks full Docker Compose feature parity

**Solution**: Migration to Docker Engine and Docker Compose

- Installed Docker Engine 28.3.2 and Docker Compose v2.38.2
- Imported all container images from Podman to Docker
- Updated test framework from podman-compose to docker compose
- Verified non-root container security preserved in Docker environment

**Impact**: Simplified orchestration with proper dependency management

### 4. Test Framework Container Runtime Transition (July 2025)

**Issue**: Comprehensive test suite built for podman-compose needed updating

- All test classes used podman-compose commands and containers
- Port conflicts between test environments and system services
- Test framework compatibility with new Docker environment

**Root Cause**: Infrastructure change required test framework updates

**Solution**: Complete test framework migration

- Updated all test classes from PodmanManager to DockerManager
- Changed command references from `podman-compose` to `docker compose`
- Fixed port mappings to avoid conflicts (DB_PORT=5433 for tests)
- Verified integration tests working with Docker Compose

**Impact**: Maintained comprehensive test coverage through infrastructure transition

## Build System Evolution

### 5. Container Build Dependency Management (July 2025)

**Issue**: Complex parallel build system needed poststack container removal

- Build scripts still referenced removed poststack-cli container
- Dependency chains needed updating after poststack elimination
- Container registry references required Docker compatibility

**Root Cause**: Build system coupled to removed poststack infrastructure

**Solution**: Build system cleanup and optimization

- Removed poststack-cli from build pipeline
- Updated container configurations for Docker registry
- Maintained parallel build efficiency for remaining containers
- Preserved dependency-aware building (base-debian â†’ others)

**Impact**: Cleaner build process with fewer dependencies to maintain

### 6. pytest Testing Framework Modernization (July 2025)

**Issue**: Testing framework had gaps after poststack removal and needed comprehensive updates

- Custom pytest markers causing warnings due to improper registration
- Integration tests creating conflicting isolated environments
- API endpoint tests failing due to missing email fields and JSON parsing issues
- Database performance tests targeting wrong schema (public vs unified)
- Limited performance testing and reporting capabilities

**Root Cause**: Testing framework not updated after infrastructure changes and missing modern testing practices

**Solution**: Complete pytest framework modernization

- Created `conftest.py` with proper marker registration using `pytest_configure` hook
- Fixed integration tests to use development environment instead of creating conflicts
- Enhanced API endpoint tests with comprehensive email handling and safe JSON parsing
- Corrected database schema references from 'public' to 'unified' schema
- Added comprehensive performance testing suite with automated reporting and baselines
- Implemented proper test isolation strategies and error handling

**Impact**: Robust testing framework with comprehensive coverage, performance benchmarks, and reliable test isolation

### 7. Environment Management System Implementation (July 2025)

**Issue**: Need for programmatic environment management and network queries

- No systematic way to query "what port is the DNS container bound to?" and similar questions
- Creating isolated test environments was manual and error-prone
- Feature branch environments could interfere with each other
- No unified interface for environment lifecycle management
- Missing network topology visibility and service discovery

**Root Cause**: Lack of comprehensive environment management tools for Docker Compose orchestration

**Solution**: Built complete environment management system

- **EnvironmentConfig**: Parses .env files and docker-compose.yml with variable substitution
- **NetworkInfo**: Provides network queries (ports, URLs, topology, connectivity tests)
- **EnvironmentManager**: Handles environment lifecycle (create, start, stop, remove)
- **EnvironmentIsolation**: Creates isolated environments with automatic port conflict resolution
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line interfaces for environment and query operations
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage with mocked Docker operations

**Key Capabilities**:

- Answer specific queries: "DNS container bound to port 5354 (bind service)"
- Create isolated test environments with automatic port offsets
- Generate feature branch environments that don't interfere
- Query service URLs, network topology, and connectivity
- Validate environment configurations

**Impact**: Complete programmatic control over environment management with CLI tools and Python APIs
